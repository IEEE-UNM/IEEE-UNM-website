The IEEE UNM Student Branch hosted an insightful STMicroelectronics Embedded Systems Workshop in collaboration with Embedmy on the 5th of November 2022. The workshop achieved its learning outcome of teaching Embedded Systems with Bluetooth Low Energy to the participants. The participants were able to successfully build and run examples of Bluetooth Low Energy such as beacon and p2p server to interface with their phones. Additionally, grasp the basic concepts of wireless communication such as Bluetooth Low Energy.
