In conjunction with International Women's Day, the IEEE UNM Student Branch held a panel forum titled Empowering Women in STEM on the 8th of March 2023. The forum was an insightful sharing session by three esteemed representatives from the industry on what it's like to be a woman in engineering. The topics discussed include the challenges they faced and how they overcame them in their journey to where they are today. This event was carried out in a panel-style manner where a discussion was carried out among the representatives. The participants also pitched into the discussion and ask questions during the QnA session. The event was held successfully, the participants were inspired by the speakers and gained invaluable advice from them.
