The IEEE UNM Student Branch held a Maze Solving Robot Competition on the 23nd of March 2024, from 9 am to 1 pm. The objective of the competition is to design and implement an autonomous robotic system capable of navigating through mazes. The components were provided to the participants by the IEEE UNM Student Branch and the prize is sponsored by Pure Integrity. The competition was held successfully where the participants gained experience in software and hardware to build a maze solving robot.
