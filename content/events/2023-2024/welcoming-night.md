The IEEE UNM Student Branch held an exciting induction night for its members on the 12th of October 2023. The purpose of this event is to welcome the club members and introduce them to the club as well as the upcoming events prepared by the club for the 2023/2024 academic year. Besides that, there were ice-breaking games to build connections between the members of IEEE UNM Student Branch. The members had a great time playing the games and interacting with committees and club members.
