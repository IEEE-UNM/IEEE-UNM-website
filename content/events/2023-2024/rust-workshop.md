The IEEE UNM Student Branch held an insightful technical workshop that taught the basics of Rust Programming on the 19th and 26th of October 2023. The participants were able to learn the fundamental concepts, syntax, and structure of the Rust programming language. Moreover, the participants were given the components to code a basic 2x16 LCD display game in Rust for hands-on experience.
