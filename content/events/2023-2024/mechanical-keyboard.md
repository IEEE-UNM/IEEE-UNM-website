The IEEE UNM Student Branch held an insightful Mechanical Keyboard Talk for all students on the 23rd of November 2023, from 7.00pm to 8.30pm. The talk was given by a student speaker, Mr. Wong from Hamster Types. This talk aims to introduce mechanical keyboards to the participants. The speaker explained the difference between mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards. Besides that, the participants also got to understand the different types of keyboard mods. At the end of the talk, a lucky draw was held for the participants. The prizes consist of mechanical keyboard parts which were kindly sponsored by Hamster Types.
