In conjunction with International Women's Day, the IEEE UNM Student Branch held a panel forum titled EmpowHER In STEM on the 7th of March 2024. The forum was an insightful sharing session by three esteemed representatives from the industry on what it's like to be a woman in STEM. The topics discussed include their view on the gender gap in STEM and their experience working in a male-dominant field. This event was carried out in a panel-style manner where discussion was carried out among the representatives. The participants also pitched into the discussion and asked questions during the QnA session. The participants were inspired by the speakers and gained invaluable advice from them.
