The IEEE UNM EPS Student Section (under the IEEE UNM Student Branch) held an exciting industrial visit to NXP Semiconductors in Petaling Jaya, Selangor on the 14th of November 2023.  

The participants gathered at the UNM bus stop at 8.30 am and departed for NXP Semiconductors via bus at 8.45 am. After arrival, the participants were welcomed by Dr. Eu who kindly offered to be our guide throughout the industrial visit. The participants toured the main lobby and some of the facilities of NXP Semiconductors. Besides that, Dr. Eu gave an insightful talk that introduced the company as well as its semiconductor assembly and packaging process to the participants. Dr. Eu also kindly invited some of her colleagues to share their experience working for NXP Semiconductors. Then, the participants were invited to have lunch and dessert at the cafeteria of NXP Semiconductors where they had a chance to chat with the representatives from NXP Semiconductors.  Finally, at 2.30 pm, the participants departed for UNM and arrived there at 3.30 pm.  

The participants enjoyed the industrial visit to NXP Semiconductors as they got to learn more about the semiconductor industry and the working culture in NXP Semiconductors.
