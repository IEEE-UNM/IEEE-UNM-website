## 1.0 Project Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
Spark Initiative is a project-based student-to-student mentorship program organized by the IEEE UNM Student Branch. The aim of this program is to help develop the technical skills of a group of club members and give them hands-on experience in creating a simple product. The mentors of this program consist of the technical executives and executive committee members of IEEE UNM Student Branch who teach useful hardware and software basics as well as useful debugging tips and tricks to the participants.

### 1.2 Goal

The project goal of Spark Initiative in the 2023/2024 academic year is to build a DIY Weather Station that is able to detect rain as well as measure the temperature, humidity, pressure, and the wind speed of its surroundings.


### 1.3 Components
![Components](images/spark/2023-2024/components.jpg "500px") 

The components used in this project are:
1. 2x16 LCD
2. Wind Speed Anemometer NPN Output
3. Rain Sensor Module
4. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
5. Arduino Uno
6. GY-68 BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor Module


## 2.0 Project Execution 
### 2.1 Hardware

The 2x16 LCD is to display the weather conditions. The Wind Speed Anemometer NPN Output measures wind speed. The Rain Sensor Module detects if it is raining. The DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor measures temperature and humidity of the surroundings. The Arduino Uno is used to read the output of the sensors and control the LCD to display the measurements. The GY-68 BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor Module measures the pressure of the surroundings.

Initially, the project intended to use the [Raspberry Pi Pico interfaced with the TFT LCD screen](https://www.instructables.com/RPi-Pico-35-Inch-320x480-HVGA-TFT-LCD-ILI9488-Bitm/). However, there was issue with finding a library that could controlled the TFT LCD Screen and due to time contraints, we could not write a library from scratch. Hence, the TFT LCD Screen was interface to a Arduino Mega, which was the microcontroller suggested by the supplier.

### 2.2 Software
The TFT LCD Sceen was controlled using the [UTFT Library](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) made by Rinky-Dink Electronics.

## 3.0 Results
