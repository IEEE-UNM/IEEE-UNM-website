## 1.0 Project Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
Spark Initiative is a project-based student-to-student mentorship program organized by the IEEE UNM Student Branch. The aim of this program is to help develop the technical skills of a group of club members and give them hands-on experience in creating a simple product. The mentors of this program consist of the technical executives and executive committee members of IEEE UNM Student Branch who teach useful hardware and software basics as well as useful debugging tips and tricks to the participants.

### 1.2 Goal

The project goal of Spark Initiative in the 2022/2023 academic year is to build a DIY arcade machine where the user can play pixel games such as Pong and Snake.


### 1.3 Components
![Components](/images/spark/2022-2023/components.jpg "500px") 

The components used in this project are:
1. Button: To get user input
2. Arduino Mega: To control the arcade display in response to user input
3. Joystick: To get user input
4. TFT LCD Screen: To display the game output


## 2.0 Project Execution 
### 2.1 Hardware
Initially, the project intended to use the [Raspberry Pi Pico interfaced with the TFT LCD screen](https://www.instructables.com/RPi-Pico-35-Inch-320x480-HVGA-TFT-LCD-ILI9488-Bitm/). However, there was issue with finding a library that could controlled the TFT LCD Screen and due to time contraints, we could not write a library from scratch. Hence, the TFT LCD Screen was interface to a Arduino Mega, which was the microcontroller suggested by the supplier.

### 2.2 Software
The TFT LCD Sceen used the [UTFT Library](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) made by Rinky-Dink Electronics
